<li>i played e1m1 in 2022 during QBJ1</li>
<li>i watched a speedrun youtube video about e1m1 it in early 2024</li>
<li>on Discord, my friend would ask me to play through my maps on stream. i did this recurring bit, where after i beat my map and got sent to <code>start</code>, i would run over to e1m1 and play a few seconds of it</li>
